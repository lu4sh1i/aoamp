The most advanced frontend drag & drop page builder. Create high-end, pixel perfect websites at record speeds. Any theme, any page, any design.

== Description ==

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kB4U67tiQLA

It's about time for a live page builder, with no limits of design. A page builder that delivers high-end page designs and advanced capabilities, never before seen on WordPress.

It's time for **Elementor Page Builder**.

= Faster. Much faster. =
Instant reaction was a key feature we wanted to achieve. Instant drag & drop, instant live edit, instant page load. The speed of Elementor is not matched by any other page builder, free or paid. This makes the interface fun and easy to work with, as well as reduces the time it takes to design.

= Live design. Truly live. =
Never again work on the backend and guess what the frontend will look like. With Elementor, you edit the page and simultaneously see exactly how it looks like. Elementor features live editing that is truly live, with no need to press update or go to preview mode.

= Surprises you won't see anywhere else. =
Create pages that have "the designer touch", by including unique features like box shadows, background overlays, hover and entrance animations, advanced buttons and more. We worked hard to create the perfect balance between full design capabilities and an intuitive and clean interface. You no longer need to use code, HTML, CSS or shortcode.

= NEW! Template Library. =
We've added **Library**, which includes a collection of 20+ beautiful templates, made for you by our top notch designers. You can also save your own pages and sections, and reuse them on different pages, or export them to whole different websites.

= 27 widgets and counting =
We packed 27 of the most useful widgets into Elementor. True, that's way more than we had to offer, but we wanted to spare no widget from you, so you can reach the top of your design capabilities.

- **Heading**. Add eye-catching headlines.
- **Image**. Control the size, opacity and other settings of images.
- **Text Editor**. A wysiwyg text editor, just like the WordPress editor.
- **Video**. Add YouTube \ Vimeo to your page.
- **Button**. Controlling every aspect of the button design.
- **Image Box**. A box that includes an image, headline and text.
- **Testimonials**. Customer testimonials that show social proof.
- **Icon**. Place one or more of 600+ icons available.
- **Icon Box**. Works the same as the image box, only with icons.
- **Social Icons**. Icons to your social pages like Facebook / Twitter.
- **Image Gallery**. Displays your images in an aligned grid.
- **Image Carousel**. A rotating carousel or slider of chosen images.
- **Icon List**. A bullet list with any chosen icon and text.
- **Counter**. Show stats and numbers in an escalating manner.
- **Progress Bar**. Include an escalating progress bar.
- **Tabs**. Multiple tabs that display different pieces of content.
- **Accordion**. A collapsable display of content.
- **Toggle**. Like Accordion, for FAQ pages.
- **Alert**. A colored alert box to draw the attention of the visitor.
- **HTML**. Insert code into the page.
- **Menu Anchor**. Link any menu to this anchor.
- **Sidebar**. Include any sidebar you create into the page.
- **Google Maps**. Embed maps into the page.
- **SoundCloud**. Add audio bits from SoundCloud.
- **Divider**. A line that divides different elements in the page.
- **Spacer**. A space that divides the various elements.
- **Columns**. Create inner columns within the column.
- **And counting...**

= Multilingual & RTL supported. =
We've integrated RTL and multi language support within the framework of Elementor, so you get a translated panel out of the box, as well as RTL typography support, and developer options to add even more languages.
